THIS TEXT FILE CONTAINS MANUAL OF 3 PROGRAMS:
 - gatherValues.py
 - makePoly.py
 - structureRefinement.py



DESCRIPTION:

	-> gatherValues.py

		PROGRAM LOOKS FOR POSSIBLY TRUE HYDROGEN BONDS BETWEEN NUCLEOBASES INTO POOL OF RNA STRUCTURES
		THE OUTPUT IS A TEXTFILE WITH THE LISTS WITH VALUES OF DISTANCES AND ANGLES
		THE NAME OF TEXTFILE IS "anglesDistancesLists.py"
		SINGLE LISTs "NAME" IS SPECIFIC DESCRIBING CONTACT

		PROGRAM OUTPUTS TOO RESULT CSV FILE AND LOG FILE
		

	-> makePoly.py

		PROGRAM IMPORTS "anglesDistancesLists.py"
		THIS PROGRAM OUTPUTS "formulas_values_mc.py" OR "formulas_polynomial_mc.py" FILE
		USER DECIDES WHICH OF THESE TWO FILES CREATE
		EACH OF THESE TWO FILES ARE NECESSARY TO RUN FOR "structureRefinement.py"
		EACH OF THESE TWO FILES CONTAINS DATA OF FITTED POLINOMIALS


 	-> structureRefinement.py

		PROGRAM IMPORTS formulas_absolute_values AND formulas_polynomial.py
		PROGRAM INPUTS PATH TO RNA STRUCTURE TO REFINE
		PROGRAM OUTPUTS REFINED STRUCTURAL MODEL OF RNA IN ORDER TO STATISTICS




REQUIREMENTS:

	-> gatherValues.py

		MODULES: BioPython, numpy
		PATH TO THE PROGRAM: ClaRNA


	-> makePoly.py

		MODULES: numpy, scipy, pylab, time, sklearn
		!!! this program imports anglesDistancesList which is created by gatherValues.py 


	-> structureRefinement.py

		MODULES: BioPython, numpy, MATPLOTLIB, Axes3D
		!!! this program imports formulas_values_mc and formulas_polynomial_mc when its run; these two modules
				are created by makePoly.py program



MANUAL:

	-> gatherValues.py

	!!! NECESSARY CUSTOMIZATION
	LINE: 289 - path to the directory which containes all output files
	LINE: 290 - path to the directory which containes PDB files with RNA structures
	LINE: 298 - path to ClaRNA
	LINE: 314 - distance

	AFTER CUSTOMIZATION gatherValues.py IS READY TO RUN BY TYPING ./gatherValues.py IN THE TERMINAL


	-> makePoly.py

	
	FOR HELP TYPE $./makePoly.py -h


	-> structureRefinement.py

	FOR HELP TYPE $./structureRefinement.py
